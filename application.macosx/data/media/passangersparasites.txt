The mother believes she awakens and her lovely daughter has disappeared. The mother has been watching a movie about a young girl with aubergine hair and round eyes. Parasitic bugs that have found solace in the skin of the girl replace her. Upon seeing the parasites, the mother falls into a deep weeping slumber and the bugs continue the mother’s dream. The bugs suppose the mother is dead, dreaming that her daughter is directing insects in a movie. The mother is at the movies with secretions that dissemble when light’s switched on. Parasites have become the daughter, dreaming a movie of a keening mother. The secretions that are raised from light, the secretions that are her thoughts. The viewer will open his eyes and go home open his heart—turn on the light—close his eyes—dream—turn in sleep—turning sleep, turning sleep become something other—a moth maybe, nothing more substantial than the filmic flame, gossamer, a damselfly’s shimmering whirr. Strangers in our body. Passengers. Parasites.
