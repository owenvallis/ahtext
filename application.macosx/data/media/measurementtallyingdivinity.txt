A scientist developed a theorem formula to measure the size and dimensions of the cosmos with the …intention of …sighting God. The space/remainder, which is not filled with matter/anti-matter, he concluded, is in fact the un-nameable or Science had finally tallied the theater of divinity. As proof, a colleague at a competitive university verified the calculations and corroborated their veracity; then, as a safeguard, she extracted measurements from scratch but through those numbers formulated a shape of varying proportion. Another scientist came to the same, rather different, conclusion—each scientist reformulating the universe in a distinctive size, each god of varying form/nonform, each calculation correct and … whole and … mind-ful, and yet unique to the individual who gathered the numbers.
