A Group of people wait outside the theater in a linear formation.  Above them, geese in a V fly to Canada. Below, a moving column of army ants marches to war. No obvious common physical attributes are shared by The Group. Socio-economic diversity, gender, race, sexual preference are variables. The Group of people communicated over the past few days in secret—Storyteller voice disembodied: a mandala sent to a Blackberry; mantras left on voice message; ideogram on rice paper arrived in the mailbox with exotic postage; mapquest on how to find Providence, a really good nearby cafe. The Group begins to observe itself, to observe one another. Did the others speak before deciding what to wear? a few wonder. How many of us have dogs? Birds? Are artists? Live alone? Have children? Have none? How did we come to be at this theater, on this night? standing beside this stranger? Illusions arise. The Group engages in a single interior smile: feelings of love for nocturnal strangers who share the moment. Illusions dispel. The Group… sees its …Siblings… in …the Group,… sees itself. Theater is inside the auditorium that The Group is waiting to enter. But more miraculous theater is taking place here where The Group stands, no longer waiting but beholding, being. The doors to the theater open, a signal that the show will soon start. The Group is disappointed. They are together, living their purpose, which is to be The Group. Once they enter the theater they will transform into the spectators—those that watch The Group. The Group looks at one another and together they blow a collective sigh, drop their tickets on the ground and leave.
