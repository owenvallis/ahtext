A friend of mine fell into a deep depression after his… wife left. We… didn't know what to do for him; he seemed to be losing his mind. He… is the most gentle soul and we never thought they made a good couple anyway. Months passed, our friend slowly revived and we began introducing him to friends of friends, women we hoped might make him happy. But after each encounter—sometimes he'd take them to the theater, other times dinner—he… would grow angry at us, or distant, or withdrawn, or belligerent, sarcastic. He would say we were taunting him, trying to fix him up with the mirror-image of his wife—the way this one wore her hair, or that one rolled her "r"s, or the other one's deep laugh. We had no idea what he was seeing in his dates. We had gone out of our way to set him up with women who shared no apparent resemblance to his ex; nevertheless, after each encounter he'd return fuming,  eyeing us with suspicion—wasting a week after the date staring into the cosmos. Finally …we …stopped trying to find him a mate. Then miraculously, one day we saw our friend garbed in his old radiance. Upon questioning him, he admitted that he met a woman the night before and felt for the first time since his wife left a deep sense: of peace, a rush of calm had filled him from the moment their eyes met, he said. He said that he… was dining with …her tonight and he… invited us to join them. We were thrilled and accepted the invitation. We… couldn't have been more surprised when the woman, who looked like the doppelganger of our friend's ex, walked through the door. During the meal we… stared in disbelief as the two glowed and gushed. The next morning our friend woke us by phone saying he… had just received a call from the police who informed him that his… wife had died the night before in a fatal car crash. He believed it was Providence.
