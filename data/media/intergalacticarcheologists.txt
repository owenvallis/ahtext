In 1900 a small band of international, intergalactic archeologists arrived at the monastery near Dunhuang, China and happened upon a nearby series of caves. One of the caves was sealed by a perfectly fitting boulder. Upon opening the cave's mouth, a sigh of smells permeated the cosmos and the group began their exploration into the deep, dank earth that carbon dating proved had been in isolate stasis since A.D. 1,000. A precious bounty of 40,000 scrolls lay buried in a cloak of providence. In ancient Chinese, translated from the original Sanskrit, the first printed book was found—The Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom of the Diamond that Cuts Through Illusion—formed from seven panels of paper and silk with written Gnostic knowledge about the indestructibility and power over illusion. The archeologists could not believe their eyes.
