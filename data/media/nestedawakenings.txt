Aware that what she had called "life" was an illusion, she lit candles and incense and sat, full lotus, 1 be-fore a 2fif-ty-foot 3sand-stone 4Bud-dha. Her eyes and mind aware.

She awoke within her sit—walked out of Providence, “stepped out” “walked out” — echo canon—while continuing out of the cosmos—left the proverbial theater. There her robe vanished, no incense, no flame—the lucidity in which scent, heat, too, are delusions gripped her no-mind, her no-form. She dropped her body antiphonal what body? What her? and traveled through the realms of spirit among the lineage of teachers, past, present, and future time? What time? What space? What time stepped what space walked this time out this space in What This Time Space What This Time Space Stepped Walked Out In Stepped Walked Out In that moment, this was kindled, and yes, again, traveling was perceived as the chimera it is—nothing more or nothing less than a Russian doll, negatively nesting inside the next.
